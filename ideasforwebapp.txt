**Ideas for webapp
create an interactive mobile phone compatible web app to be hosted fully on netlify free account. (can host working files on GitHub if needed). 

- The webapp will be populated with names of players across the top 5 european football leagues - include Champions League, Europa League, Conference League and all other local domestic league cups e.g., the FA Cup in England, Copa Del Rey in La Liga, DFB-Pokal in Bundesliga, etc.... )
- User to register in the webapp platform with their forum handle ONLY (must be enforceable somehow)
- Users (called pundits) can only choose max of 5 players across 5 leagues but no more than 1 player per league.
- Users should not be able to see other users selections
- Players cannot change selection once the season starts - date to be set.
- Users can change injured players for another one but cannot repick the same injured player again
- Player stats to focus on (Non-penalty goals, Penalty goals, Assists, Man of the match and if a player played 90 mins or more. 
- Assign points to players based on their stats using a preset formula 
  	20 points - Non Penalty goals (NPG)
 	15 points - Penalty goals (PG)
  	10 Points - Assist
	5 Points - Man or player of the match (MOTM)
	5 Points - if player played 90 mins or more in a single match
	Minus 5 points - For yellow cards (YC
	Minus 10 points - for Red Cards
- Find an open source or ANY free stats website where stats can be automatically populated from. No manual processes
- Assign points to players based on their stats
- Assign total points to users based on the players selected
- Include a leader board (top 3 for both users and players - add a star to the player, a trophy to the user) to show where the goals and points are coming from
- Include names of players selected by user underneath their names
- Suggest any of idea that could make this app interesting for users
